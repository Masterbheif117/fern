###Inspiration

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects your hormones. It causes numerous physical, hormonal/emotional complications, such as irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth/loss, acne, mood swings, etc. People with PCOS may be at higher risk for certain health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure as well. Our team member has PCOS, so she was able to speak from personal experience. PCOS is surprisingly common, and even more surprisingly, it is frequently undiagnosed and untreated.

##What it does

Our app has three main features, a PCOS catered meal planner that creates recipes of authentic foods (cuisine of your choice!) that cater towards PCOS nutrition needs, such as insulin/magnesium deficiencies, as well as replacing ingredients that may be harmful. Fern also offers a PCOS specific fitness planner tailored towards the users goals, age, weight, etc. Lastly, Fern has a daily symptom tracker/journal that logs physical and emotional changes/symptoms that can be exported at the end of each month as a PDF to be shown to a physician/gynecologist (can double as a period tracker as well). This is for recognizing patterns/triggers as well as specific timings.

##How we built it

We used Next.js, Typescript, Javascript, JWT for auth, jpdf for exporting data as a pdf, and fun fact, our teammate Nivisha actually hand-drew almost half of all of our components, including the logo, flowers, ferns, plants, icons, etc.

##Challenges we ran into

Coming up with a design that wasn't too in your face about female empowerment but a more unisex, mature design that properly addresses the sensitive topic that is PCOS.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

In 24 hours we managed to flesh out all of our core features, polish the UI, and cover edge cases.

##What we learned

How to handle user auth and keep a persistent state of data. Our teammate learned web development for the first time as well.

##What's next for Fern

Some sort of community aspect could be implemented.
