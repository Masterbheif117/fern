# Fern  
Winner for best UI/UX at Hackviolet 2025
## 🌿 Inspiration  

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It can lead to various physical, hormonal, and emotional complications, including irregular menstrual cycles, excessive hair growth or loss, acne, mood swings, and increased risks of conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.  

One of our team members has firsthand experience with PCOS, which gave us unique insights into the challenges it presents. Despite how common PCOS is, it often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Our goal with **Fern** is to provide a practical, supportive solution for managing PCOS through personalized nutrition, fitness, and symptom tracking.
